# What is ChatGPT

- ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI based on GPT-3.5. It has a remarkable ability to interact in conversational dialogue form and provide responses that can appear surprisingly human. Large language models perform the task of predicting the next word in a series of words.

- ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

- ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. Its uneven factual accuracy was identified as a significant drawback.[3] Following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI was valued at US$29 billion.

# What is OpenAI

- OpenAI is an American Artificial Intelligence (AI) research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI Incorporated (OpenAI Inc.) and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI Limited Partnership (OpenAI LP). OpenAI conducts AI research to promote and develop friendly AI in a way that benefits all humanity. The organization was founded in San Francisco in 2015 by Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Peter Thiel and others, who collectively pledged US$1 billion. Musk resigned from the board in 2018 but remained a donor. Microsoft provided OpenAI LP a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a second multi-year investment in January 2023, reported to be $10 billion

## Methods

- I have made use of the [`text-davinci-003`](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3) model, which is the most capable GPT-3 model. It can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following. Also supports [inserting](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/inserting-text) completions within text.
- Tested and deployed the chat-bot with a lower sampling-temperature value so that it takes lesser risks and gives
  well-defined answers.
